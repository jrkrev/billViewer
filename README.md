This project uses HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, and MySQL.

How to Use
--------------------
A MySQL server must be running on the local host. Execute the script "RUN_ONLY_ONCE.sql" 
found in the "SQL script" folder as root before using. This will create the billViewerDB 
and a billViewerUser that accesses the database. From there, the database can be populated 
using the forms found in this application.
